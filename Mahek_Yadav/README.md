# 🛒 E-Commerce Product & Shopping Cart API

A lightweight RESTful E-Commerce backend API built using Node.js and Express.js. The API provides product catalog management, user authentication, shopping cart functionality, stock validation, and checkout operations.

The project uses JSON files with Node.js `fs/promises` for asynchronous data persistence instead of a traditional database.

```

### Filtering Example

```text
/api/products?category=Electronics&minPrice=1000&maxPrice=5000
```

### Sorting Example

```text
/api/products?sort=price_asc
```

The endpoint supports:

* Category filtering
* Minimum price
* Maximum price
* Stock filtering
* Price sorting
* Product searching

---

## Get Product by ID

**GET**

```text
/api/products/:id
```

Example:

```text
/api/products/prod_101
```

---

## Add Product

**POST**

```text
/api/products
```

### Request Body

```json
{
  "name": "Mechanical Keyboard",
  "category": "Electronics",
  "price": 1899,
  "stock": 25,
  "rating": 4.5
}
```

---

## Update Product

**PUT**

```text
/api/products/:id
```

### Request Body

```json
{
  "stock": 30,
  "price": 1799
}
```

---

## Delete Product

**DELETE**

```text
/api/products/:id
```

Example:

```text
/api/products/prod_101
```

---

# 🛒 Shopping Cart APIs

Cart APIs require the user to be authenticated.

## View Cart

**GET**

```text
/api/cart
```

Returns the current user's cart along with calculated totals.

---

## Add Item to Cart

**POST**

```text
/api/cart/items
```

### Request Body

```json
{
  "productId": "prod_101",
  "quantity": 1
}
```

Before adding an item, the API checks whether sufficient stock is available.

If the requested quantity exceeds available stock, the API returns:

```text
400 Bad Request
```

with an insufficient stock message.

---

## Remove Item from Cart

**DELETE**

```text
/api/cart/items/:productId
```

Example:

```text
/api/cart/items/prod_101
```

---

## Checkout

**POST**

```text
/api/cart/checkout
```

The checkout process:

1. Checks whether the cart is empty.
2. Validates product availability.
3. Calculates the order total.
4. Decreases product stock.
5. Completes the checkout.
6. Updates the cart data.

---

# 🗄️ Data Storage

This project does not use MongoDB, Firebase, Supabase, or any other database.

Data is stored in JSON files:

```text
data/
├── products.json
├── users.json
└── carts.json
```

The project uses Node.js `fs/promises` for asynchronous reading and writing of JSON data.

Example:

```javascript
const fs = require("fs/promises");
```

This allows the application to persist data without using a traditional database.

---

# 🔒 Middleware

The project contains reusable middleware for different backend requirements.

### Auth Guard

Checks whether a user is authenticated before accessing protected cart routes.

### Logger

Logs incoming API requests for easier monitoring and debugging.

### Product Validation

Validates product information such as:

* Price must be greater than 0
* Stock cannot be negative
* Required product fields must be present

---

# 🧪 API Testing

The API can be tested using tools such as:

* Postman
* Thunder Client
* REST Client
* Browser for GET requests

### Recommended Testing Flow

1. Register a new user.
2. Login using the registered credentials.
3. Fetch the product list.
4. Test product filtering and sorting.
5. Add a product to the cart.
6. Try adding more quantity than available stock.
7. View the cart.
8. Remove an item from the cart.
9. Add an item again.
10. Checkout.
11. Verify that the product stock has decreased in `products.json`.
